Create a PHP program inside an HTML page that displays a student’s result. Your program must follow these steps:

Create a variable $name to store a student’s name.

Create an associative array named $marks that contains three subjects and their marks:

PHP → 85

JavaScript → 90

Database → 80

Inside the HTML body, display the student’s name using PHP.

Using a foreach loop, display each subject and its mark
